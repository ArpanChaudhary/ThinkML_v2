# ThinkML

ThinkML is a Python library that converts natural language prompts into executable machine learning code. It provides an intuitive interface for performing common ML tasks through simple text commands.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing of ML Tasks:** Converts user prompts into structured commands.
- **Automatic Code Generation:** Generates Python code for common ML workflows (data description, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization).
- **Support for Various ML Models:** Includes logistic regression, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and more.
- **Built-in Visualization:** Supports ROC curves, feature importance plots, correlation heatmaps, and confusion matrices.
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Provides metrics like accuracy, F1 score, MSE, and RÂ².
- **Dataset Description and Analysis:** Tools for summarizing and analyzing datasets.

## Project Structure

- **`thinkml/`**: Core source code.
  - **`thinkml_engine.py`**: Main engine that coordinates prompt processing, code generation, and execution.
  - **`engine/`**: Contains the `PromptRefiner` for normalizing and refining natural language prompts.
  - **`model/`**: Includes `trainer.py` for training and evaluating multiple models.
  - **`algorithms/`**: Contains implementations of various ML algorithms (logistic regression, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).
  - **`preprocessing/`, `visualization/`, `evaluation/`, etc.**: Additional modules for data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Installation

To install ThinkML, run the following command:

```bash
pip install thinkml
```

## Quick Start

```python
from thinkml import ThinkMLEngine
import pandas as pd

# Initialize the engine
engine = ThinkMLEngine()

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
engine.set_data(data)

# Process natural language prompts
result = engine.process("Describe the dataset")
result = engine.process("Train a decision tree model")
result = engine.process("Plot feature importance")
```
