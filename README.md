## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

1. **Missing C++ Build Tools (Windows)**
   ```bash
   # Solution 1: Install pre-built wheels
   pip install --only-binary :all: thinkml[boost]
   
   # Solution 2: Install Build Tools
   # Download and install from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**
   ```bash
   # Install with minimal dependencies first
   pip install thinkml
   
   # Then add components as needed
   pip install "thinkml[boost]"
   ```

3. **Version Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Create a fresh virtual environment
   python -m venv thinkml_env
   source thinkml_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   thinkml_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   
   # Install ThinkML
   pip install "thinkml[all]"
   ```
