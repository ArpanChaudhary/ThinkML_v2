# ThinkML

ThinkML is a powerful Python library that converts natural language prompts into executable machine learning code. It provides an intuitive interface for performing common ML tasks through simple text commands.

## Features

- Natural language processing of ML tasks
- Automatic code generation for common ML workflows
- Support for various ML models and algorithms
- Built-in visualization capabilities
- Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
- Dataset description and analysis tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install thinkml
```

## Quick Start

```python
from thinkml import ThinkMLEngine
import pandas as pd

# Initialize the engine
engine = ThinkMLEngine()

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
engine.set_data(data)

# Process natural language prompts
result = engine.process("Describe the dataset")
result = engine.process("Train a decision tree model")
result = engine.process("Plot feature importance")
```

## Supported Tasks

- Dataset description and analysis
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training (various algorithms)
- Model evaluation
- Visualization (ROC curves, feature importance, etc.)
